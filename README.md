# ROSDOX

Nightly implementation of a documentation system for ROS Launchfiles based on [xacro](https://github.com/ros/xacro) and [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) providing Latex files.
Build the package and use xacro as usual, but with a ROS launch file as input. The contained arg tags are documented
and the included files are traversed and documented.
The include hierarchy is visualised using a Graphviz tree.

The [xacro](https://github.com/ros/xacro) package was modified to achive this functionality. The output can be integrated into a Doxygen Latex documentation.
The doxygen.sty file is required and the generated output can be included into the refman.tex file generated by doxygen.

## Install

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install dot2tex
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/nicolasfrick/rosdox.git
$ cd .. && catkin build xacro
```

## Run

```
$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
$ xacro -o<output directory> <filepath>.launch
$ dot2tex -ftikz --figonly <output directory>/grapviz_tree.gv   >   <output director>/grapviz_tree.tex
```

## WARNING:
This code contains bugs and the correctness of the output is not guaranteed.

### Xacro (XML Macros)

**Xacro is an XML macro language**

With `xacro`, you can construct shorter and more readable XML files by using macros that expand to larger XML expressions.
Recent documentation can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/ros/xacro/wiki). For older releases, have a look at the [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/xacro).
